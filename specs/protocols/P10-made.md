# P10 — Multi-Agent Delegation Exchange

> Signed, attenuated delegation + result exchange between agents. No privilege amplification; hop count; quorum; evidence requirements; trust-domain federation.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Protocol ID** | P10 |
| **Name** | made (Multi-Agent Delegation Exchange) |
| **Spec-only canonical** | Yes — see [`../../docs/00-reconciliation-matrix.md`](../../docs/00-reconciliation-matrix.md) §9 |
| **Consumed by** | I1 (multi-agent future) |
| **Schema location** | `specs/protocols/P10-made.schema.json + .cddl` |
| **Base standards** | SPIFFE, OAuth RAR/DPoP, OCSF, OTel, CycloneDX/SPDX, OMS, MITRE ATLAS (as applicable) |

## Purpose

Signed, attenuated delegation + result exchange between agents. No privilege amplification; hop count; quorum; evidence requirements; trust-domain federation.

The protocol is **language-neutral**. It is defined once here and consumed identically by every
language implementation via the contract plane (see
[`../../docs/cross-cutting/19-inter-component-protocol.md`](../../docs/cross-cutting/19-inter-component-protocol.md)).

## Schema sketch (CDDL / protobuf)

The normative schema lives at `specs/protocols/P10-made.schema.json + .cddl`. Mandatory fields:

```
envelope: protocol, version, message_id, issuer, issued_at, expires_at, nonce, critical_extensions, extensions
payload:  delegator, delegatee, parent_authority_digest, delegation_chain, hop_count, max_depth, capabilities, parent_budget, delegated_budget, quorum, approvals, evidence_requirements, result_digest, status
signature: algorithm, key_id, value
```

(Field names are stable; renaming is a breaking change requiring a new protocol version per the
governance rules in `specs/protocols/README.md`.)

## Signing

Every instance is signed by the issuer using T1 trust-core (Ed25519 by default; KMS/HSM in
production). The signature covers the canonical-CBOR encoding of the protocol message. The
Sigstore Rekor transparency log entry is returned for non-repudiation.

## Revocation

- **Expiry:** every instance carries an explicit expiry timestamp; expired instances are rejected
  without further checks.
- **Revocation handle:** issuers may revoke by publishing the revocation handle to
  `aumos.<domain>.revoked.v1` CloudEvent on Kafka.
- **Propagation:** revocation propagates fleet-wide within the I-05 budget (identity <5s,
  credentials <1s).
- **Partial disclosure:** protocols support selective disclosure where the use case requires it
  (e.g. zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive authority claims — future work).

## Adversarial test vectors

Each protocol ships adversarial test vectors in `testvectors/protocols/P10/`:

- **Replay** — expired and re-used instances are rejected.
- **Tampering** — any field modified post-signing fails verification.
- **Confused deputy** — an instance presented to the wrong audience is rejected.
- **Privilege amplification** — a delegation chain whose intersection would expand authority is
  rejected (invariant I-02).
- **Downgrade** — an instance claiming an unsupported protocol version is rejected.
- **Replay across contexts** — a receipt from one task replayed in another is detected by
  `subject` + `jti` uniqueness.

Conformance is enforced by the protocol vector suite in
[`testvectors/protocols/`](../../testvectors/protocols/). Coverage by language is reported by
`tools/conformance/run.py`; a language absent from that report has not been verified against
these vectors.
